# tasks-CodSoft
Source codes of the tasks given as an intern assessment.

These tasks, which were seemingly interesting, had an informative beginning. I had quite a blocks as I delved further into the tasks, after which I acknowledged to acquire new approaches to solve a particular problem. These tasks made me evaluate my speed and absorption of the problem statements as well as the overall ability to understand things to a more clear level. The main agenda of me attempting these tasks was to have a challenge, and challenge was delivered. Here are a few I worked on :

**Task 1 : Number Game**
A console-based interface, which has two modes to generate a random number; an existing method and  code generated(pseodo).The user can easily changge his preference and guess the number within five atttempts. The display code of number is commented and can be modified accordingly. Creating the code generated method had to be new algortihm which was intersting to work on.

**Task 2 : Word Counter**
The code can accept both user given or hardcoded input and displays the total number of words displayed, along with the number of common words. The number of words after removing the common words is also provided.I  prefered it doing it in a straight-forward way of a single class code.

**Task 3 : ATM-Interface**
A console-based interface, has two major operations, to deposit or to withdraw amount, A default amount has been set in-order to have a initial transaction in place or to withdraw from. User can navigate within the operations and can perform every possible trannsaction accordingly.
